# Eight Essential Tips: Abstract

These core principles have guided me during my (almost) two decades in the business. I'll share some real-world stories to show what kind of results you can expect.

The tips:

1. Just ask.
2. Listen fully.
3. Tell stories.
4. Own your work. <!--maybe-->
5. Find go-to people.
6. Minimum viable is your friend. <!--don't love this wording-->
7. Always keep learning.
8. Say yes.

There might even be a surprise bonus tip! This talk is for all documentarians, with a slight skew to those newer to the discipline.
